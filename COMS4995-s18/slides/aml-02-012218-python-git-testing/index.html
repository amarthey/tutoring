### W4995 Applied Machine Learning

# Tools and Infrastructure

01/22/18

Andreas C. Müller

???

Hey. Welcome to the second lecture on applied machine learning. Last
week we talked a bit about very general and high-level issues in machine
learning. Today, we’ll go right down to the metal. Actually, things we
will talk about today are more generally about software engineering and less
specifically about machine learning. If
you want to build real-world systems, software engineering practices
are really incredibly important.
For those of you from CS, I hope this is a reminder, for those of
you from DSI, some this is maybe new.
We’ll talk about version control, in particular git, about some basic
python, about testing, continuous integration and about documentation.
Also, I apologize in advance for the slides. There’s a lot of bullet
points and few diagrams and I don’t really like that.

# So you think you know git?

???

So this first part is about git. I assume you all know about git. Who
here has not used git so far?
If you haven’t this might be a bit steep for you, and you should read
up on it later. Let me know if I’m going to fast.
I assume that you know what version control is and why it’s
important. You should really use version control any time you work on
any code or any other document. And it looks like we’ll have to use
git for now and some time to come.
So you all have used git, but who of you thinks they understand git? Ok
I’ll keep you in mind and ask you trick questions along the way.

---

class: center, middle

![:scale 40%](images/git_xkcd.png)

???
Here’s a comic from xkcd that might seem familiar. I know many people
that use git by just memorizing some commands and if things go south,
they just delete the repository and start fresh.
Who of you have done that? I certainly have.
The goal of today is that you never have to throw your hands up ever
again.

---

class: center, middle

![:scale 40%](images/torvalds_ducreux.jpg)

???
Personally I like to think that git was a practical joke played on the
open source community by Linux Torvals.
Unfortunately, I think the real issue is that kernel developers, genius
as they might be, are not the best at creating user interfaces. Git is
great, but the user interface is horrible. But let’s try and understand
what’s going on.

---

# Git Basics

- Repository

`$ git init`

`$ rm .git`

???
There are some basic units of git that I want to go through. The first
is a repository. What’s a repository?
A folder who’s content we want to track with version control.
And how can you create one?
Run git init in a folder.
And how can you make a folder not a repository any more?
By removing the .git subfolder. That’s it.
A repository is entirely self-contained. There is no service or database
or anything like that, it’s all plain files within that folder. That
also means if you remove the folder, you lose everything if you don’t
have a backup.

The next basic concept is a commit. What’s that?
It’s a snapshot of the state of the folder, with a message attached,
and identified with an ID. It’s also a node in a graph that describes
the history of the snapshot, and usually has one or two parents, and
can have arbitrary many children.
The ID is a hash of the state and all the parents, so if you change
anything, you change the hash and therefore the commit.

The last basic concept I want to talk about is the remote. That’s just
a pointer to another repository, often github, but it could also just be
another folder on your computer.
You can synchronize with that by pushing or pulling changes. 
--

- Commit

--

- Remote

---

# Typical Workflow

- Clone

- Branch

- Add, commit, add, commit, add, commit, ...

- Merge / rebase

- Push

???
So here’s a typical workflow for making a change to an existing
project. You clone the project from some remote repository. You change
some files, add them, and commit them.
Then you push them to the remote repository.
That’s more or less what you’ll do with your homework.

The advanced version of this is after cloning you create a branch, you
make all your changes on the branch, and once you’re done, you merge
the changes from your branch into the master branch.

Everybody good so far?
I want to give some basic tips that will help you even with these simple
workflows.

---

# Some tips

- `$ git status`

- Install shell plugins for status and branch (`oh-my-zsh`)

![:scale 90%](images/git_shell_extension.png)

- Set editor, pager and diff-tool (check out meld!)

- Use `.gitignore`

???
You should always call git status, to see what’s happening with your
repository. It will tell you whether you changed anything, and which
branch you’re on.
I actually highly recommend using a plugin for your shell, that will give
you the status in every line. If you use zsh, you can use oh-my-zsh for
example. If you use something else like bash, there are also plenty of
options out there.

You should also set your editor and pager to something that is familiar
to you. The default editor is vim, and if you’re not a vim user, you
might want to change that. It’s also helpful to set up a diff program
that you like. I like meld for example, that allows you to compare whole
folders in a nice way.

You should also use gitignore. It's a simple text file that allows you to
ignore certain files or folders or file types. For example, you could ignore
all .pyc files. Or you could ignore all .ipynb-checkpoints or your dataset
folder.

---

# Git log

![:scale 80%](images/git_log.png)

???
You should also become friends with git log. Git log allows you to
view the history of your repository. It has a couple of very helpful
options. Plain git log will have very long output and show full commit
messages.

If you want short summaries, use oneline.

Often, it’s also useful to annotate branches, which you can do with
A
the decorate option.
If you want to show more than just the branch you’re on, you can use
the all option.

Now it’s a bit hard to track the relations of the different commits,
though, and you might want to use the graph option to show the structure
of the history.

You might want to alias a command like that because it’s rather long
to type, but very informative. I’ll show you an alternative in a bit.

# Understanding Git

- Working directory

- Repository (Commit graph, history)

- Index (Staging Area)

- Branches

- Head

???
So now, I want to work towards really understanding git, and here
are some lower level concepts that are important. First, the working
directory. That’s the actual current content of the folder on disk.
Then there is a graph of commits, also known as the history. Formally that's called
the repository, though usually I think of the repository as the whole thing. It's a directed
acyclic graph that contains all the changes and contains the information
about the parents of a commit.
Then the index. The index is what's also called the staging area,
it's an intermediate space in which you accumulate changes you want to put in a commit.
Branches are quite simple. They are just pointers to particular commits. They
point to certain commits.
Head is another pointer. Head points to the current active branch. That
is the branch that will be updated if you make a commit. (unless you’re
on no branch, in which case you are headless)
The state of you repository is really much more than the state of the
directory, it’s the state of all of these five things together. And
if you think about commands, you should think about them in terms of
what they do to each of these five.

---

# git Commands

.smaller[
- .normal[`git add`]<br />
puts files from working director into staging area (index) If not tracked so far, adds them to tracked files.

- .normal[`git commit`]<br />
commits files from staging area (index) to repository, moves current
branch with HEAD

- .normal[`git checkout [<commit>] [<file>]`]<br />
Set `<file>` in working directory to state at `<commit>` and stages it.

- .normal[`git checkout [-b] <branch>`]<br />
moves HEAD to `<branch>` (-b creates it), changes content of working dir

- .normal[`git reset --soft <commit>`]<br />
moves HEAD to `<commit>` (takes the current branch with it)

- .normal[`git reset --mixed <commit>`]<br />
moves HEAD to `<commit>`,  changes index to be at `<commit>` (but not
working directory)

- .normal[`git reset --hard <commit>`]<br />
moved HEAD to `<commit>`, changes index and working tree to `<commit>`.
]

???
Ok so now, let’s got through some of the commands and talk about what
they do in terms of these five concepts
[read slide]

---
class: center

![:scale 60%](images/git_data_transport.png)

???
I found this data flow diagram online and I think it's quite helpful for a subset of the commands.
It shows how you can propagate changes from the working directory to a remote repository and back.
This is only a small part of all the commands, though. For example reset is missing, and generally
nothing that moves branches or head is here.

---

# Merge

- Fast-forward merge:

![:scale 90%](images/git_fast_forward_merge.png)

- Merge-commits:

![:scale 90%](images/git_merge_commit.png)

???

Now let's talk about the  the more complex operations to the repository or
history, merging and rebasing. They change the commit graph, and possibly the working
tree. I find it most helpful to think of them as graph operations on the repository.

Let's start with merges.
There’s two kinds of merging: feed-forward merges, and merges that
require a commit. If one commit is a descendants of the other and you
merge them, it will be a feed-forward, and just move the branch.
That happens for example if you just pull new changes from a remote
repository that you cloned, if you haven't made any local changes.

However, if one isn’t a descendant of the other, git will create a
“merge commit” that will unite the two, and have both as its
parent. Git will attempt its best but if there’s conflicting changes,
you might need to resolve the conflicts by hand.

---

# Rebase

- Rebase<br/>
![:scale 50%](images/git_rebase1.png)

- Rebase onto<br />
`git rebase --onto master next`
.left-column[
![:scale 80%](images/git_rebase2.png)
]
.right-column[
![:scale 80%](images/git_rebase3.png)
]

???
Rebase is a whole different beast. It allows more or less arbitrary
modifications of the graph, and therefore rewriting history.
You should be aware that if you use rebase, you will change a commit's
hash because the hash depends on the history.
Basically what rebase does is place a range of commits on top of another
commit. If you're on branch A and you do git rebase B (or any other commit),
what will happen is that it will find the common ancestor, take everything
up to that ancestor, and place it on branch B.
You can change the commit that it puts the changes on top of by using
the --onto flag. So if I want to take the last five changes I do git
rebase HEAD~5 --onto B
That will take the common ancestor with HEAD~5, which is HEAD~5, and
place it onto B.


---
# Interactive rebase

`git rebase -i <commit>`

![:scale 66%](images/git_interactive_rebase.png)

???
You can make rebase even more complicated - and powerful, by making it
interactive. While you could make any rebase interactive, it’s most common to
rebase on an ancestor with interactive – in this case a non-interactive rebase would have no
consequences.
For each commit in the range that you want to rebase, interactive rebase
allows you to pick the commit, which is leave it alone, squash it,
which means incorporating it into the previous commit, removing it or
amending it.
Interactive can be useful for cleaning up your history after you worked
on a feature, so that the remaining commits are logical units.

---
class: center, middle
# Squash before Rebase

???
Rebasing can also create conflicts that need to be resolved the same way
as merge conflicts. However, rebasing “plays back” all the commits
that you moved on top of the target commit. That means that you might
have to resolve conflicts on the same file multiple times – which you
probably want to avoid.

A good way to get around that is to squash all the commits you want to
rebase into a single one, and then rebase that single commit. That means
you only have to do conflict resolution once.

So before you do a rebase on a different branch, you might do an
interactive rebase to squash some commits and make conflict resolution easier.

---

# Interactive adding

![:scale 55%](images/git_interactive_add.png)

???
What I find even more important is interactive adding. With git add,
you usually add whole files to the staging area. I rarely ever do
that. Usually I want to check line by line what changes I made and what
changes I want to commit.
Git add -i allows me to through all the different hunks or lines
I changed.
However, the command line interface is a bit clumsy for my taste. Or
maybe I’m just not as used to it.
I prefer a gui, which you can summon with git gui on the command line.

---
class: center, middle

# git gui

![:scale 80%](images/git_gui.png)

???
Git gui is basically an interface for git add and git commit. You can
also use it to push, but not much more.
This is the way I create most of my commits. You can see very easily
which files have changed, see the changes, and stage single lines or
whole files.
Then you enter the commit message here, and click commit.

---
class: center, middle

# gitk

![:scale 80%](images/gitk.png)

???
Another tool that I use all the time is gitk.
This is basically a graphical interface to git log, showing you the
history of your project. But you can also use it as a graphical interface
for reset, and for cherry-picking, which we won’t go into.
Often I run gitk with gitk –all, which will show you all the
branches. This is quite similar to the
Git log –oneline –anotate –graph –all that I did earlier –
but now in a gui!
This is usually how I do resets and how I look at the graph before I do
any merges or rebases.
You can also use gitk to search commit messages, and there are many option
on what to display and how. I mostly use the options to selectively show
some branches that I’m interested in.

---

# reflog
.left-column[
`$ git reflog`
![:scale 100%](images/git_reflog.png)
]
.right-column[
<br \>
![:scale 100%](images/git_simple_merge_graph.png)
]
???
The last command I want to mention is reflog.
Reflog is a very powerful tool that allows you to go through the history
of your project, but not the same was as log. Reflog actually tracks
the changes to HEAD that you do with all the crazy commands that we
talked about.
Log and gitk will only show you commits that are part of branches. If
you do a rebase, for example, all the previous commits are still there,
but not part of a branch any more. Remember, rebasing creates new hashes,
so the rebased commits are different commits.
Imagine you want to go back to some states that are not part of any branch
any more. Reflog allows you to do that. So if you break something during
a rebase, or you lost a commit, you can always find it with reflog!

# Git for ages 4 and up:

(with play-doh!)

???
For some of you, this was probably too slow, and for some of you, this
was probably too fast.
Who here knew already all of this?
So for those of you who I managed to totally confuse, I recommend you
go through these slides again, and also watch this video. It’s pretty
good, but it’s also pretty long.
And for those of you who though this was wayyy to much detail: this
was still not all the important parts. There’s also tags, and bare
repositories and the stash and cherries...

---
class: center, middle

# Github - just another remote

???
I want to just briefly talk about github.
For the purposes of git, github is just another remote. And it’s really
nothing special. In terms of being a remote, you can replace github with
a usb stick that you hand around.
There is a lot of tools for user management and issue tracking which is
great, but not really central what we’re talking about here. The main
thing that’s different in using github from using any other remote,
is the use of pull requests, and the ability to integrate with remote
services.
For now lets talk about pull requests, we'll come back to the services later.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 50%](images/forks1.png)
???

So what are pull requests for?
Basically they allow you to contribute to a repository to which you
don’t have write permissions.
Let’s say you want to contribute to scikit-learn. Or to the lecture slides.

There’s the main repository, which we usually call "upstream",
scikit-learn/scikit-learn. You want to change something there, but you
don’t have write permissions.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 50%](images/forks2.png)
???

What you can do is "fork" it on github – that’s a github concept,
not a git concept. It’s just a clone that also lives on github.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 50%](images/forks3.png)
???
To actually make any changes, you
can then clone this fork locally, add a feature branch, make changes
and push them.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 50%](images/forks.png)
???

Then you can ask the owner of the repository if they want to merge your
changes. That's a pull request and allows the owner to "pull" in your
changes into the main repository.

So far, so good. Makes mostly sense, I think.
There is a slight oddity in this workflow, though.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 60%](images/forks_master_feature.png)
???

Usually you pull the current status from the master branch,
and make some changes that you want to include. So you always pull master
and push feature branches.
But the code in the upstream repository changes. How do you get
these changes onto your laptop? 
If the original repository gets updated, there is no way to directly update your fork.

---
class: center

# Github pull request workflow
<br />
![:scale 60%](images/forks_master_feature2.png)
???
You have to add upstream as an additional remote, and then you can pull from
there. You can create new features on top, and push the feature branches to
your fork (which is usually the “origin” remote).
But what happens with the master branch on your fork? It never gets
updated and there is no point in pushing to it, so it will just sit there
and rot, staying at the state of the original repository at the time of your fork.
I think that’s kind of weird, but that’s how github works.
So you always pull from upstream to get their changes, and push to
your fork.
---
class: center, middle

# End version control – but github will come back later ;)

???
Ok, so that’s enough version control for now. But we’ll get back to
githubs integration of third party services later.

---
class: center, middle

# General coding guidelines

???
Next, I want to talk about Python and some software engineering
principles. But before we do that, I want to mention two famous quotes
that provide great general guidelines for software development.

---
class: middle

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
machines to execute.
.quote_author[Harold Abelson (wizard book)]

???
The first one is by Harold Abelson from the foreword of “structure
and interpretation of computer programs” a classic in programming
languages and compilers.
[read]
The gist is that the main point of code is to communicate ideas to your
peers and to your future self.
A similar sentiment is expressed in the statement that “code is read
more often than it is written”. Take more time writing code, so that
you and other can spend less time reading it. Don’t focus on what’s
“easy for the computer” or “elegant”. Focus on what’s easy to
understand for people.

---
class: middle

Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in
the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,
how will you ever debug it?
.quote_author[Brian Kernighan]

???
This one is from Brian Kernighan, who wrote the first book on C together
with Dennis Richie. Kernighan is also the creator of awk and many other
parts of unix, in particular the name. He says
[read]
This is another call for simplicity. Make code easy to understand. For
yourself now to debug, for your future self to know what the hell you were
thinking, and for others that might want to use this code in the future.
Hopefully all the code you write will be read again. Otherwise, what’s
the point? That might not be true for your assignments in most classes,
but the point of the assignments it to practice for the real world. So I
want to make sure that the code that you write in class is on the same
standard that it needs to be out there on your job. Also, think of the
poor course assistants.

---
class: padding-top

- Don’t be clever!


- Make it readable!


- Future you is the most likely person to try to understand your code.



???
So to summarize:
[read]

And there's one more trick to making your code readable and understandable.
Don't write code. The more you write, the more you need to read. If you can
avoid writing code, do it! If you can get a 10% speedup by making your code
three times as long, usually it's not worth it.

--
- Avoid writing code.

# Python basics

???
So now I want to go over some Python basics. And don’t worries, we
won’t go over syntax or the standard library.

---
class: spacious

# Why Python?

- General purpose language
- Great libraries
- Easy to learn / use
- Contenders: R (Scala? Julia?)

???
First, a short defense on why I’m teaching this class in Python.
Python is a general purpose programming language, unlike matlab or R,
so you can do anything with it.
It is very powerful, mostly because there are so many libraries for
python that you can do basically anything with just a couple of lines.
Python is arguably easy to learn and easy to use, and it allows for a
lot of interactivity.
The only real contender in the data science space that I can think of
is R, which is also a good option, but well, I’m not an R guy. Much
of this course could be taught in R instead, though the software
development tooling is a bit worse (but other things are better).
You might have better chances with Python in industry jobs.
There’s also Scala, but I’d argue that’s way too complicated and
doesn’t have the right tools for the kind of data analysis and machine
learning we want to do in this course.

# The two language problem

Python is sloooow…


- Numpy: C
- Scipy: C, fortran
- Pandas: Cython, Python
- Scikit-learn: Cython, Python

- CPython: C

???
So there’s one thing that I really  don’t like about Python. Any
idea what that is?
Python is slooow. Like really slow.
So you know all these great libraries for Python for data science, like
numpy, scipy, pandas and scikit-learn. Do you know what language they
are written in?
Numpy is written in C,
Scipy is written in C and Fortran, pandas and scikit-learn are written
in Cython and Python. And Cpython, the interpreter we use, is written
in … C obivously
That creates a bit of a divide between the users, who write python,
and the developers, who write C and Cython. I have to admit, I don’t
write a lot of Cython myself, mostly Python… but that’s not great.
So you need to be aware that if you actually want to implement new
algorithms, and you can’t express them with pandas and numpy, you
might need to learn cython.
For this course, this won’t really be a problem, though. We’ll stay
firmly on the Python side.

# Python 2 vs Python 3

- “current” : 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

???
There’s another thing that you could call the two language problem,
it’s python 2 vs python 3.
The last version of python 2 is python 2.7, and really no-one should be
using anything earlier. The commonly used versions of python 3 are 3.4
and 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.
There is really no reason to use python 2 any more. Unless you already
wrote lots of code earlier. If you’re at a company it might not be
easy to make the  transition, and that’s why python 2 is still around.

So the important part are the changes. Anyone know what changed?

--

Changes (that will bite you)

- `print`

- division

- Iterators (range, zip, map, filter, dictionary keys, values, items)

- Strings / unicode

???
The print statement was removed, now print is a function, so it need
parenthesis. The most common and trivial change. Division was changed
to produce floats, so if you devided 2 by 3, it was 2 before, and now
it’s 2.5

Then, many things that returned lists now return iterators, which is more
memory efficient, but means you can’t necessarily retrieve things by
index any more. That’s true for range, which now behaves like xrange
before, zip, which behaves like izip, map and filter.
Also, dictionary keys, values and items are now iterables and not
lists. If you tried to index any of those, you probably had a bug anyhow.

And really the main thing that changed is strings. And they changed
completely. In 2, there was a string type and a unicode type. Now
there’s a string type, which is always unicode, and a bytes type that
is the raw bytes and needs an encoding to interpret.
The story is really a bit complicated, and I suggest you read up on it.
If your standard environment is Python2, you should update it to Python3
today.

# Python 2 && Python 3

- `from __future__ import print_function`
- Six – tools for making 2 and 3 compatible code
- 2to3 – convert python2 code to python3 code

???

If you write a library or code that you want to have reused, I suggest writing
code that is compatible with both python 3 and python 2. Hopefully soon we
can write Python3 only. For the first assignment I’ll make you do that, for
later assignments the code only needs to run in 3.4 or newer.

Generally it’s easy for code to run on both. You can just always
use parenthesis on print, it will have no effect in python2. Or you
can import features, like float division from the future. ` __future__`
is a module that exists in python2 and python3 and that allows you to
use certain python3 feature in python 2.
Some cases are not covered, though, and the `six` package helps out in
these cases. It provides some common names between python2 and python3.
If you want to convert a codebase from python2 to python3, there’s an
automatic converter called 2to3, which can do that for you.

The next thing I want to talk about is managing python packages and environments.

# Python ...

Package management:

- don't use system python!

- use Virtual environments

- understand pip (and wheels)

- probably use Conda (and anaconda or conda-forge)

???
Package management is really important if you want to become a serious python user.
Unfortunately, it’s a bit tricky, partly due to the two language problem, which
means packages have dependencies that are not in python.
First of, you should be aware of the environment you are using. Usually
it’s a good idea to work with virtual environments, in which you can
control what software is installed in what version. If you’re on OS X
or linux, your system will com with some python, but you don’t really
want to mess with that. Create your own environments, and are aware of
which environment you are using at any moment.
The standard python way to install packages is pip, which is part of
the setuptools package. Pip allows you to install all python packages in the pipy
repository, which is basically all of them.

--
???
Until not so long ago, pip needed to compile all C code locally on your
machine, which was pretty slow and complicated. Now, there are binary distributions,
called wheels, which mean no compilation for most packages! If you’re compiling
something when you’re installing, you’re probably doing it wrong.
The issue with pip is that it only works for python packages, and some
of our packages rely on linear algebra packages like blas and lapack,
and you need to install them some other way.
A really easy work-around for that is using a different package manager,
called conda. It was created by a company called Anaconda (used to be continuum
IO) and they ship a bundle called anaconda, which installs basically all the
important packages. I recommend you use that for the course.
Conda can be used with different source repositories. By default, it uses
the anaconda one that is managed by the company. There’s also an open
repository that is managed by the community that’s called conda-forge.
In practice I use both conda and pip.

# Pip and conda and upgrades

- Pip upgrade works on dependencies (unless you do -no-dep)

- pip has no dependency resolution!

- conda has dependency resolution

- Use conda environments!

- upgrading a conda package with pip (or vice versa) will break stuff!

???
Oh and one word of warning: if you do pip upgrade somepackage, it will
also update all the dependencies. That is often not what you want, in
particular if you are using it in a conda environment or if you installed
a particular version of numpy or scipy that you don’t want upgraded.
An imporatant thing to keep in mind about pip is that it has no dependency
resolution, which means it will install the dependencies for any
package you install, but it won't care about all the packages you installed
before. So whenever you're using pip to install something, it could potentially
break an already installed package.
Conda on the other hand has a dependency resolution mechanism, which means
it'll ensure that all the packages that you installed are compatible with each other.
Sometimes there are conflicts between packages, though, which might prevent
you from installing certain combinations.
The solution here is to make liberal use of conda environments.
If you need to work on a specific project, you should have a conda environment
for that project ant it's requirements. Conda environments are really very useful
and easy to use.

Finally, don't try to upgrade a package with pip if it was installed
with pip or the other way around. So if you mix conda and pip, make sure
you check which one you used before upgrading. I recommend to use conda
whenever possible.

# Environments and Jupyter Kernels
.smaller[
- Environment != kernels
- Use nb_conda_kernels or add environment kernels manually:

.smallest[
```bash
source activate myenv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
source activate other-env
python -m ipykernel install --user --name other-env --display-name "Python (other-env)"
```
]
- Even with `nb_conda_kernels`: need to install `ipykernel` package.
]
.left-column[
![:scale 100%](images/kernel_other_env.png)
]
.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/kernel_other_env2.png)
]
???

If you're using conda environments, you will want to use them in your jupyter notebooks.
However, jupyter is not immediately aware of your environments. Jupyter runtime environments
are defined by kernels, which can be python environments, or different programming languages.
You need to make sure that jupyter is aware of your environments to use them as a kernel.
One way is to manually add them by using this command here which invokes `ipykernel install`.
That works with any kind of python environment.
For conda environments specifically, you can also install the `nb_conda_kernels` package,
which will automatically create kernels for all environments that contain the `ipykernel`
package. If you do either of them, you'll get a choice of which kernel you want to use for
a notebook. That's a great way to use different versions of python, like 2 and 3, or different
versions of scikit-learn or matplotlib or anything else.

There is a bit more tooling around python that I want to talk about next.

# Dynamically typed, interpreted

- Invalid syntax lying around

- Code is less self-documenting

???
One of the reasons Python is so easy to learn and use is because it’s
a dynamically typed languages.
So who of you have worked with statically typed languages like C, C++,
Java or Scala?
It’s often a bit cumbersome that you have to declare the type of
everything, but it provides some safety nets. For example you know that
if the code compiles, the syntax is correct everywhere. You don’t know
whether the code does what you want, but you know it’ll do something.
Mabye crash your machine, but whatever.
Also, arguably, dynamically typed code is less self-documenting. If I write a
function without documentation, it’s very hard for you to guess what I
expect the input types to be. There’s now type annotations for Python,
which is great, but they are not supported in Python2 and are not adopted
everywhere yet. So how can we get back our safety nets?

# Editors

- Flake8 / pyflake

- Scripted / weak typing: Have a syntax checker!

- write pep8 (according to the standard, not the tool)

- use autopep8 if you have code lying around

???
One of the simplest fixes is to have a syntax checker in your
editor. Whatever editor you’re using, make sure you have something like
flake8 or pyflake installed that will tell you if you have obvious errors.
These will also tell you if you have unused imports, undeclared variables
or unused variables. All that helps you to immediately fix problems,
and not wait until you run your program.
I also recommend having a style checker. Flake8 also enforces pep8,
which is the python style guide.
You should write pep8 compatible code. It will make it easier for others
to read your code, and once you’re used to it, it’ll make it easier
for you to read other’s code.
If you want to convert code to be pep8 compatible, check out the autopep8
package. The pep8 tool is very strict these days, and I don't heed
all the warnings. There is a configuration file you can use to silence
the more obnoxious ones. When I say you should write pep9, I mean
you should write according to the standard, not the tool.
The first guideline of pep8 is to use your own judgment and not
blindly follow the guide.
