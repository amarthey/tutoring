# Linear Models for Classification

02/05/18

Andreas C. Müller

Today we're going to talk about linear models for classification, and in addition to that
some general principles and advanced topics surrounding general models, both for classification
and regression.

FIXME: in regularizing SVM, long vs short normal vectors.

# Linear models for <strong>binary</strong> classfication

???
We'll first start with linear models for binary classification, so if there are only two classes.
That makes the models much easier to understand.

---
.center[
![:scale 55%](images/linear_boundary_vector.png)
]

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b) = \text{sign}\left(\sum\limits_{i}w_ix_i + b\right)$$

???
Similar to the regression case, basically all linear models for classification have the same way
to make predictions. As with regression, they compute an inner product of a weight vector w with
the feature vector x, and add some bias b. The result of that is a real number, as in regression.
For classification, however, we only look at the sign of the result, so whether it is negative
or positive. If it's positive, we predict one class, usually called +1, if it's negative,
we predict the other class, usually called -1. If the result is 0, by convention
the positive class is predicted, but because it's a floating point number that doesn't really
happen in practice. You'll see that sometimes in my notation I will not have a $b$. That's because
you can always add a constant feature to x to achieve the same effect (thought you would then need
to leave that feature out of the regularization). So when I write $w^Tx$ without a $b$ assume
that there is a constant feature added that is not part of any regularization.

Geometrially, what the formula means is that the decision boundary of a linear
classifier will be a hyperplane in the feature space, where w is the normal vector of that plane.
In the 2d example here, it's just a line separating red and blue. Everything on the right hand side
would be classified as blue by this classifier, and everything on the left-hand side as red.

Questions?
So again, the learning here consists of finding parameters w and b based on the training set,
and that is where the different algorithms differ. There are quite a lot of algorithms out
there, and there are also quite a lot in scikit-learn, but we'll only discuss the most common ones.

The most straight-forward way to approach finding w and b is to use the framework
of empirical risk minimization that we talked about last time, so finding parameters that
minimize some loss o the training set. Where classification differs quite a bit from
regression is on how we want to measure misclassifications.


---

# Picking a loss?

$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{y_i \neq \text{sign}(w^T \textbf{x} + b)}$$`

.center[
![:scale 40%](images/binary_loss.png)
]

???
So we need to define a loss function for given w and b that tell us how well they fit the training set.
Obvious Idea: Minimize number of misclassifications aka 0-1 loss
but this loss is non-convex, not continuous and minimizing it is NP-hard.
So we need to relax it, which basically means we want to find a convex upper bound for this loss.
This is not done on the actual prediction, but on the inner product $w^T x$, which is also called the decision function.
So this graph here has the inner product on the x axis, and shows what the loss would be for class 1.
The 0-1 loss is zero if the decision function is positive, and one if it's negative.
Because a positive decision function means a positive predition, means correct classification in the case of y=1.
A negative prediction means a wrong classification, which is penalized by the 0-1 loss with a loss of 1, i.e. one mistake.

The other losses we'll talk about are mostly the hinge loss and the log loss. You can see they are both upper bounds on the
0-1 loss but they are convex and continuous.
Both of these losses care not only that you make a correct prediction, but also "how correct" your prediction is, i.e.
how positive or negative your decision function is.
We'll talk a bit more about the motivation of these two losses, starting with the logistic loss.

# Logistic Regression


.left-column[
$$\log\left(\frac{p(y=1|x)}{p(y=0|x)}\right) = w^T\textbf{x}$$

$$p(y|\textbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-w^T\textbf{x}}}$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} -\sum_{i=1}^n \log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1)$$`


$$\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T\textbf{x} + b)$$
]
.right-column[
![:scale 100%](images/img_3.png)]


???
Logistic regression is probably the most commonly used linear classifier, maybe the most commonly used classifier overall.
The idea is to model the log-odds, which is log p(y=1|x) - log p(y=0|x) as a linear function, as shown here.
Rearranging the formula, you get a model of p(y=1|x) as 1 over 1 + ...
This function is called the logistic sigmoid, and is drawn to the right here. Basically it squashed the linear function $w^Tx$
between 0 and 1, so that it can model a probability.

Given this equation for p(y|x), what we want to do is maximize the probability of the training set under this model.
This approach is known as maximum likelihood. Basically you want to find w and b such that they assign maximum
probability to the labels observed in the training data. You can rearrange that a bit and end up with this equation here,
which contains the log-loss as seen on the last slide.

The prediction is the class with the higher probability. In the binary case, that's the same as asking whether
the probability of class 1 is bigger or smaller than .5.
And as you can see from the plot of the logistic sigmoid, the probability of the class +1 is greater than .5
exactly if the decision function $w^T x$ is greater than 0.
So predicting the class with maximum probability is the same as predicting which side of the hyperplane
given by w we are on.

Ok so this is logistic regression. We minimize this loss and get a w which defines a hyper plane.
But if you think back to last time, this is only part of what we want. This formulation
tries to fit the training data, but it doesn't care about finding a simple solution.

# Penalized Logistic Regression

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1) + ||w||_2^2$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + 1) + ||w||_1$$`

- C is inverse to alpha (or alpha / n_samples)

- Both versions strongly convex, l2 version smooth (differentiable).

- All points contribute to $w$ (dense solution to dual).

???

So we can do the same we did for regression: we can add regularization terms using the L1 and L2 norm.
The effects are the same as for regression: both push the coefficients towards zero, but the l1 norm
encourages coefficients to be exactly zero, for the same reasons we discussed last time.

You could also use a mixed penalty to get something like the elasticnet. That's not implemented
in the logisticregression class in scikit-learn right now, but it's certainly a sensible thing to do.

Here I used a slightly different notation as last time, though. I'm not using alpha to multiply the
regularizer, instead I'm using C to multiply the loss. That's mostly because that's how it's done
in scikit-learn and it has only historic reasons. The idea is exactly the same, only now C is 1 over alpha.
So large C means heavy weight to the loss, means little regularization, while small C means less weight on the
loss, means strong regularization.

Depending on the model, there might be a factor of n_samples in there somewhere. Usually we try to make
the objective as independent of the number of samples as possible in scikit-learn, but that might
lead to surprises if you're not aware of it.

Some side-notes on the optimization problem: here, as in regression, having more regularization
makes the optimization problem easier. You might have seen this in your homework already, if
you decrease C, meaning you add more regularization, your model fits more quickly.

One particular property of the logistic loss, compared to the hinge loss we'll discuss next is that
each data point contributes to the loss, so each data point has an effect on the solution.
That's also true for all the regression models we saw last time.

# (soft margin) linear SVM

.larger[
`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\max(0,1-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) + ||w||_2^2$$`

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}}C \sum_{i=1}^n\max(0,1-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i)+ ||w||_1$$`
]

- Both versions strongly convex, neither smooth.

- Only some points contribute (the support vectors) to $w$ (sparse solution to dual).

???
Moving from logistic regression to linear SVMs is just a matter of changing the loss
from the log loss to the hinge loss. The hinge-loss is defined as ...
And we can penalize using either l1 or l2 norm, or again, in principle also elastic net.
This formulation with the hinge loss doesn't really make sense without the penalty,
because of the formulation of the hinge loss.
What this loss says is basically "if you predict the right class with a margin of 1, there is no loss".
Otherwise the loss is linear in the decision function. So you need to be on the right side
of the hyperplane by a given amount, and then there is no more loss.
That's the reason you need the penalty, for the 1 to make sense. Otherwise you could just scale up
$w$ to make it far enough on the right side. But the regularization penalizes growing $w$.

The hinge loss has a kink, same as the l1 norm, and so it's not a smooth optimization problem
any more, but that's not really a big deal. What's interesting is that all the points
that are classified correctly with a margin of at least 1 have a loss of zero, and so they
don't influence the solution any more.
All the point that are not classified correctly by this margin are the ones
that do influence the solution and they are called the support vectors.

FIXME graph of not influencing the solution?

FIXME: motivate SVM? we'll do it in two lectures...

???

So this is the main difference between logistic regression and linear SVMs:
Does it penalize misclassifications according to the green line, or according to the blue line?
In practice it doesn't make a big difference.

---


# SVM or LogReg?

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/svm_or_lr.png)
]

- Need compact model or believe solution is sparse? Use L1

???
So which one of them should you use? If you need probability estimates,
you should use logistic regression. If you don't, you can pick either, and it doesn't really matter.
Logistic regression can be a bit faster to optimize in theory.
If you're in a setting where there's many more feature than samples, it might make sense to use linear SVMs and solve the dual,
but you can actually solve either of the problems in the dual, and we'll talk about what that means in practice in a little bit.

---

# Effect of regularization


.center[
![:scale 90%](images/linear_svm_regularization.png)
]

- Small C (a lot of regularization) limits the influence of individual points!

???

So I spared you with coefficient plots, because they looks the same as for regression. All the things I said about model
complexity and dependency on the number of features and samples is as true for classification as it is for regression.

There is another interesting way to thing about regularization that I found helpful, though.
I'm not going to walk through the math for this, but you can reformulate the optimization problem and find that what the C
parameter does is actually limit the influence of individual data points. With very large C, we said we have no regularization.
It also means individual data points can have basically unlimited influence, as you can see here. There are two outliers
here, which basically completely tilt the decision boundary.
But if we decrease C, and therefore increase the regularization, what happens is that the influence of these outlier points
becomes limited, and the other points get more influence.

FIXME illustration for support vectors?

# Multiclass classification


???

Ok, so I think that's enough on the two loss functions and regularization, and hopefully you have a bit of a feel for
how these two classifiers work, and also an understanding that they are in fact quite similar in practice.

Next I want to look at how to go from binary classification to multi-class classification.
Basically there is a simple but hacky way, and there's a slightly more complicated but theoretically sound way.

# Reduction to Binary Classification
.padding-top[
.left-column[
## One vs Rest
]

.right-column[
## One vs One

]
???
The slightly hacky way is using what's known as a reduction.
We're doing a reduction like in math: reducing one problem to another.
In this case we're reducing the problem of multi-class classification into
several instances of the binary classification problem.
And we already know how to deal with binary classification.

There are two straight-forward ways to reduce multi-class to binary classification.
the first is called one vs rest, the second one is called one-vs-one.

---

# One Vs Rest

For 4 classes:

1v{2,3,4}, 2v{1,3,4}, 3v{1,2,4}, 4v{1,2,3}

In general:

n binary classifiers - each on all data

???
Let's start with One vs Rest.
here, we learn one binary classifier for each class against the remaining
classes. So let's say we have 4 classes, called 1 to 4.  First we learn a
binary classifier of the points in class 1 vs the points in the classes 2, 3
and 4.  Then, we do the same for class 2, and so on.
The way we end up building as many classifiers as we have classes.

# Prediction with One Vs Rest


"Class with highest score"

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg}\max_{i \in Y} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x}$$

Unclear why it works, but work well.


???
To make a prediction, we compute the decision function of all classifiers,
say 4 in the example, on a new data point. The one with the highest score for the positive
class, the single class, wins, and that class is predicted.

It's a little bit unclear why this works as well as it does. Maybe there's some papers
about that now, but I'm not 

So in this case we have one coefficient vector w and one bias b for each class.

---

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_lines.png)
]


???
Here is an illustration of what that looks like. Unfortunately it's a bit hard
to draw 4 classes in general position in 2 dimensions, so I only used 3 classes here.
So each class has an associated coefficient vector and bias, corresponding to a line.
The line tries to separate this class from the other two classes.
# Fixme draw ws?

# One vs Rest Prediction

.center[
![:scale 80%](images/ovr_boundaries.png)
]


???

Here are the decision boundaries resulting from the these three binary classifiers.
Basically what they say is that the line that is closest decides the class.
What you can not see here is that each of the lines also have a magnitude associated with them.
It's not only the direction of the normal vector that matters, but also the length.
You can think of that as some form of uncertainty attached to the line.

---

class: some-space

# One Vs One

- 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, 2v3, 2v4, 3v4
- n * (n-1) / 2 binary classifiers - each on a fraction of the data


- "Vote for highest positives"
- Classify by all classifiers.
- Count how often each class was predicted.
- Return most commonly predicted class.
- Again - just a heuristic.


???

The other method of reduction is called one vs one.
In one vs one, we build one binary model for each pair of classes. In the
example of having four classes that is one for 1 vs 2, one for 1v3 and so on.
So we end up with n * (n - 1) /2 binary classifiers. And each is trained only
on the subset of the data that belongs to these classes.

To make a prediction, we again apply all of the classifiers. For each class
we count how often one of the classifiers predicted that class, and we
predict the class with the most votes.

Again, this is just a heuristic and there's not really a good theoretical explanation
why this should work.

# One vs One Prediction

![:scale 80%](images/ovo_lines.png)


???
Here is an example for predicting on three classes in 2d using the one-vs-one heuristic.
In the case of three classes, there's also three pairs. Three is a bit of a special case,
with any more classes there would be more classifiers than classes.

The dashed lines are colored according to the pair of classes they separate. So the green
and blue line separates the green and blue classes. The data points belonging to the grey
class were not used in building this model at all.
---

class: center
# One vs One Prediction


![:scale 80%](images/ovo_boundaries.png)


???

Looking at the predictions made by the one vs one classifier the correspondence to the binary
decision boundaries is a bit more clear than for the one vs rest heuristic, because
it only takes the actual boundaries into account, not the length of the normal vectors.
That makes it easier to visualize the geometry, but it's also a bit of a downside
of the method because it means it discards any notion of uncertainty that was
present in the binary classifiers.
The decision boundary for each class is given by the two lines that this class is involved in.
So the grey class is bounded by the green and grey line and the blue and grey line.

There is a triangle in the center in which there is one vote for each of the
classes.  In this implemenatation the tie is broken to just always predict the
first class, which is the green one.
That might not be the best tie breaking strategy, but this is a relatively rare case, in particular
if there's more than three classes.

OVR and OVO are general heuristics not restricted to linear models.
They can be used whenever a binary model for classification needs to be extended to the multi-class
case.
For logistic regression, there is actually a natural extension of the formulation, and we don't
have to resort to these hacks.

# Multinomial Logistic Regression

Probabilistic multi-class model:

$$p(y=i|x) = \frac{e^{\textbf{w}_i^T\textbf{x}}}{\sum_j e^{\textbf{w}_j^T\textbf{x}}}$$

`$$\min_{w \in ℝ^{p}} \sum_{i=1}^n \log(p(y=y_i|x_i))$$`

$$\hat{y} = \text{arg} \max_{i \in Y} \textbf{w}_i\textbf{x}$$

- Same prediction rule as OvR !

???
The binary logistic regression case can be generalized to multinomial logistic regression, in which
we model the probability that i is one of the classes using this formula, which is also known as softmax.
The probability is proportional to e to the minus $w^t x$ which is the same as in the binary case.
But now we need to normalize it so that the sum over all classes is one. So we just divide it by this sum.

# Stochastic Gradient Descent

- Logistic Regression:

`$$F(w) = -C \sum_{i=1}^n\log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + ||w||_2^2$$`


- Pick $x_i$ randomly, then

`$$\frac{d}{dw}F(w) = \frac{d}{dw} -C \log(\exp(-y_iw^T \textbf{x}_i) +1 ) + \frac{1}{n}||w||_2^2$$`

- In practice: just iterate over i.


???
Is a stochastic approximation of gradient of F with expectation the actual gradient.

# SGD and partial_fit

- SGDClassifier(), SGDRegressor() fast on very large datasets
- Tuning learning rate and schedule can be tricky.
- partial_fit allows working with out-of-memory data!


???
- SGDClassifier(), SGDRegressor() fast on very large datasets – have many different loss and regularization options.
- Tuning learning rate and schedule can be tricky. “optimal” learning rate only works with unitvariance data. Averaging can be helpful.
- partial_fit allows working with out-of-memory data!
