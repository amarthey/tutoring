# Clustering and Mixture Models

03/26/18

Andreas C. Müller

???
Today we're gonna talk about clustering and mixture models, mostly clustering algorithms.
Next time we'll talk about evaluation of clustering.

VB GMM: explain better? better example? or leave out?

FIXME: order of slides weird, in particular K-Means (also agglomerative and others lol)

# Clustering

???


The ideas is that you start out with a bunch of data points, and the assumption is that they fall into groups or clusters, and the goal is to discover these underlying groups.
---
.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cluster_intro_1.png)
]

???
For example you want to find that these points belong to the same groups, and these, and these.
---
.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cluster_intro_2.png)
]

???

---
.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cluster_intro_3.png)
]

???
The cluster algorithms have many parameters, and one of the most common ones is the number of clusters.
In this dataset I drew here, it's quite obvious that there are three groups,
and if it's this obvious there is usually a way to figure out how many groups
there are. But for many algorithms, you need to specify the number of groups in
advance.

---

.center[
![:scale 70%](images/cluster_intro_4.png)
]

???
Group into 4 clusters


If you misspecify the number of groups you'd get something like this. We're not
gonna talk about how to tune these parameters today, but in general you either
need to have some prior knowledge about the data, or you need to inspect the
results manually to see if the parameters are good.  We're gonna talk more
about this next time.

Often, you don't know the number of clusters, or if there are even clusters in
the data. Very rarely is the case as clear as in this example.  Still there
might be a reasonable grouping, so there is no "right" amount of clusters, but
you might still get something out of the clustering.

# Clustering

- Partition data into groups (clusters)
- Points within a cluster should be “similar”.
- Points in different cluster should be “different”.

???


So you want to partition the data, so that each data point belongs to exactly one of the groups.
And you want to define groups such that points in the same cluster are similar, and points in different clusters are different.
And the different algorithms define how they measure similarity in different ways.

What we're really interested in is the partitioning of the data, though the way
it's implemented in the scikit-learn API is that you predict an integer for
each data point, so the clusters are numbered 0.. n_clusters -1. So we'd label
these points with 0, these with one, and so on. But you should keep in mind
that the number themselves have no meaning, renumbering the clusters
corresponds to the same clustering.  We're really only interested in which
points have the same labels and which points have different labels.


- Number of clusters might be pre-specified.
- Notations of “similar” and “different” depend on
algorithm or user specified metrics.
- Identify groups by assigning “cluster labels” to
each data point.
FIXME!
---

# Goals of Clustering

- Data Exploration
  - Are there coherent groups ?
  - How many groups are there ?

--

- Data Partitioning
  - Divide data by group before further processing

--

- Unsupervised feature extraction
  - Derive features from clusters or cluster distances

???
So why would we want to use a clustering algorithm? The main usage that I've
come across is exporation of the data and understanding the structure of the
data. Are there similar groups within the data? What are these? How many are
there?  You can also use clustering to summarize or compress the data by
representing each group by a single prototype, say the center.
You can also use clustering if you want to divide your data, for example if you
want to know different parts of the dataset behave fundamentally differently,
so you could for example cluster a dataset, and then apply, say, a linear
model, to each cluster. That would create a more powerfull model than just
learning a linear model on the whole dataset.


Another use is unsupervised feature extraction. You can also use clustering to derive a different representation of the data.

An often cited application of clustering is customer segmentation, though I'd say data exploration or feature extraction are more common.

# Clustering Algorithms

???
So now let's start discussing some of the standard algorithms.
---

class: center, middle

# K-Means

???
One of the most basic and most well-known ones is kmeans.
Here k stands for the number of clusters you're trying to find.
---

# K-Means Algorithm

.wide-left-column[
.center[
![:scale 100%](images/kmeans.png)
]
]

.narrow-right-column[
.smaller[
- Pick number of clusters k.
- Pick k random points as
“cluster center”
- While cluster centers change:
  1. Assign each data point to it’s closest cluster center
  2. Recompute cluster centers as the mean of the assigned points.
]
]

???
The algorithm proceeds like this: you pick the number of clusters k,
then you randomly pick k data points from the data, and declare those as cluster centers.
Then, you label each data point according to which cluster center it is closest to.
Finally, you recompute the cluster centers as the means of the clusters, and you iterate.
The algorithm always converges, which is when the assignment of the points to the clusters doesn't change any more.
Often you might want to not wait until full convergence, but just stop if the cluster centers don't move much between iterations.

So you can see the green cluster center moving towards the red here until it has captured all the points in this group.
Questions?
Who has seen this before?

# Objective function for K-Means
<br \>
<br \>
`$$\Large \min_{\mathbf{c}_j \in \mathbf{R}^p, j=1,..,k} \sum_i ||\mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{c}_{x_i}||^2 $$`
$\mathbf{c}_{x_i}$ is the cluster center $c_j$ closest to $x_i$
???
- Finds a local minimum of minimizing squared distances (exact solution is
NP hard):
- New data points can be assigned cluster membership based on existing clusters.

Here is what this algorithms actually optimizes, the objective function.
It's the sum of the distances of the cluster centers to all the points in the clusters.
So the clusters centers are c_j and we want to find cluster centers such that the sum of the distance of each point to its closest cluster center is minimized.
This is an NP hard problem, so we can't really hope to solve it exactly, but we can run the k-means algorithm that we just discussed, and it will provide us with some local minimum of this objective.
There's a couple of nice things about this algorith;
It's very easy to write down and understand. Each cluster is represented by a center, which makes things simple, and you can reassign any new point you observe to a cluster by just computing the distances to all the cluster centers.
So in this case, if we build a model on some data that we collected, we can easily apply this clustering to new data points. That's not the case for all clustering algorithms.

# Initialization

- Random centers fast.
- K-means++ (default):
Greedily add “furthest way” point
- By default K-means in sklearn does 10 random
restarts with different initializations.

# Feature Extraction using K-Means

- Cluster membership → categorical feature
- Cluster distanced → continuous feature
- Examples:
  - Partitioning low-dimensional space (similar to using basis functions)

within epsilon - “dense region”
- Start with a core sample
- Recursively walk neighbors that are core-samples and
add to cluster.
- Also add samples within epsilon that are not core
samples (but don’t recurse)
- If can’t reach any more points, pick another core
sample, start new cluster.
- If newly picked point has not enough neighbors, label outlier
- Outliers can later be relabeled to belong to a cluster.

# (Gaussian) Mixture Models

# Mixture Models

- Generative model: find p(X).

` $$ p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_k p_k(\mathbf{x} | \theta) $$ `

???
- Assume form of data generating process
- Mixture model assumption:
  - Data is mixture of small number of known distributions.
  - Each mixture component distribution can be learned "simply"
  - Each point comes from one particular component
- We learn the component parameters and weights of
components

---

# Gaussian Mixture Models

`$$ p(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{j=1}^k \pi_k \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_k, \Sigma_k) $$`

`$$ k \sim \text{Mult}(\pi), x \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}, \mu_k, \Sigma_k)$$`
???
- Each component is created by a Gaussian distribution.
- There is a multinomial distribution over the components
- non-convex, depends on initialization

FIXME algorithm deserves a bit more explanation?

--

- Non-convex optimization.
- Initialized with K-means, random restarts.
- Optimization (EM algorithm):
    - Soft-assign points to components.
    - Compute mean and variance of components.
    - Iterate

# Bayesian Infinite Mixtures

- Bayesian treatment:
  - Add priors on mixture coefficients and Gaussians.
  - Can “unselect” components if they don’t contribute.
  - Possibly more robust
- Infinite Mixtures:
  - Replace Dirichlet Prior over mixture coefficients by Dirichlet Process.
  - “automatically” finds number of components (based on parameter of
the prior).
- Both implemented in BayesianGaussianMixture
- Use variational inference (as opposed to gibbs sampling)
- In practice: need to specify upper limit of components
